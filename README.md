## - Created by GiggyMantis -

Glossorola is a desktop app for the creation of [constructed languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language).
It consists of several modules, such as the Dictionary Module, Phonology Module, Grammar Module, and Evolution Module. 
It allows for high-efficiency diachronic and synchronic conlanging, as well as providing tools for creating high-quality documentation and visuals.

# Warnings

The evolution module is sensitive to years only. If you have two sound changes that need to be applied in a particular order, and you put them in the same year, it may cause unintended effects.
Consider changing them to one, larger sound change mutation or seperating them by 1 year.
